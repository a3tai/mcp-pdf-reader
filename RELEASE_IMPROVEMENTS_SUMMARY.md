  - Tag creation and pushing

### Documentation
- **`docs/RELEASE.md`** - Comprehensive release process documentation
- **`RELEASE_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary document

## üöÄ Key Improvements

### Release Workflow Enhancements

#### Before
- Manual release creation required
- Static release notes
- No code signing
- Basic artifact organization
- No pre-release handling

#### After
- **Automatic Release Management**: Tag push triggers complete release pipeline
- **Smart Release Notes**: Auto-generated from commits with categorization (Features, Bug Fixes, Documentation, Other)
- **Cross-Platform Code Signing**: All binaries signed and verified
- **Professional Packaging**: Ready-to-install packages with installation scripts
- **Pre-release Support**: Automatic detection and proper GitHub marking

### Code Signing Implementation

#### Security Features
- **Certificate Protection**: Secure storage in GitHub secrets
- **Multi-Platform Support**: macOS, Windows, and Linux signing
- **Verification**: Automatic signature validation
- **Timestamp Verification**: Ensures long-term validity

#### Platform-Specific Features
- **macOS**: Developer ID signing with runtime hardening and notarization support
- **Windows**: Authenticode signing with timestamp server validation
- **Linux**: GPG detached signatures for integrity verification

### Automation Benefits

#### Developer Experience
- **One-Command Releases**: `./scripts/prepare-release.sh v1.2.3`
- **Validation Built-in**: Pre-release checks prevent failed releases
- **Error Prevention**: Git state validation and version format checking
- **Dry-Run Support**: Test releases without making changes

#### Release Quality
- **Consistent Process**: Standardized workflow reduces human error
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Automated test runs before release
- **Professional Packaging**: Ready-to-use installation packages
- **Complete Documentation**: Generated release notes and installation guides

## üõ† How to Use

### Quick Release Process
```bash
# Prepare and create a new release
./scripts/prepare-release.sh v1.2.3

# For pre-releases
./scripts/prepare-release.sh v1.2.3-beta.1

# Test without making changes
./scripts/prepare-release.sh v1.2.3 --dry-run
```

### Code Signing Setup (One-time)
```bash
# Set up certificates for all platforms
./scripts/cert-management/setup-certs.sh setup-macos --cert-file cert.p12
./scripts/cert-management/setup-certs.sh setup-windows --cert-file cert.pfx  
./scripts/cert-management/setup-certs.sh setup-linux

# Generate GitHub Actions secrets template
./scripts/cert-management/setup-certs.sh prepare-secrets
```

### Release Workflow
1. **Prepare**: Run pre-release script with version
2. **Automatic**: GitHub Actions builds, signs, and publishes
3. **Verify**: Check release page and test downloads
